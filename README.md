# Microscope images such as H&E images register to spatial transcripts or DNA images

A MATLAB-based tool for manually registering microscope images to spatial molecular data.

Overview

MATLAB is a powerful tool for computer vision, offering numerous toolboxes such as the Registration Estimator, which includes several automated methods for image registration. While these techniques are effective in many scenarios, they often fall short when applied to H&E images and spatial transcriptomic data due to the complexity and variability of the images.

For cases where automated methods fail to produce satisfactory results, manual alignment becomes necessary. The scripts provided in this repository are specifically designed to help you manually register these images.

Usage
    The repository is for technologies has no ready to use software to align H&E image to spatial transcripts such as merscope, trekker slide tag. 
    Experiment with the automated techniques available in the Registration Estimator toolbox.
    If none of the automated methods yield acceptable results, use the provided scripts for precise manual alignment.
