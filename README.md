#Trekker_Slide_Tag_H-E_Image_Registration

A MATLAB-based tool for manually registering H&E images to spatial transcriptomic data.

Overview

MATLAB is a powerful tool for computer vision, offering numerous toolboxes such as the Registration Estimator, which includes several automated methods for image registration. While these techniques are effective in many scenarios, they often fall short when applied to H&E images and spatial transcriptomic data due to the complexity and variability of the images.

For cases where automated methods fail to produce satisfactory results, manual alignment becomes necessary. The scripts provided in this repository are specifically designed to help you manually register these images.

Usage

    Experiment with the automated techniques available in the Registration Estimator toolbox.
    If none of the automated methods yield acceptable results, use the provided scripts for precise manual alignment.
